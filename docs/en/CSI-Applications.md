## Specific Case Scenarios

- **Case 1: Positioning and Ranging**: Learning the RSSI method and using CSI as a more informative fingerprint (including signal amplitude and phase information across multiple subcarriers), or relying on frequency-selective fading models to achieve more accurate ranging. The high precision of CSI in positioning and ranging makes it a superior choice compared to traditional RSSI.
Achieving high-precision indoor positioning with CSI overcomes the limitations of traditional positioning technologies.
- **Case 2: Smart Home**: Utilizing CSI information to provide personalized smart home services, enhancing user experience and home security.
- **Case 3: Industrial IoT**: Optimizing the monitoring and management of industrial equipment based on CSI, improving the level of industrial automation and intelligence.
- **Case 4: Intruder Detection**: Selecting highly sensitive subcarrier combinations and non-line-of-sight path direction signals in multipath propagation environments to enhance the sensitivity and range of passive human detection. This method can form a "blind-spot-free" intrusion detection system in security applications. The multipath propagation characteristics of wireless signals indoors provide natural advantages in sensing distance and directionality.
- **Case 5: Human Activity Detection and Recognition**: Using CSI's high sensitivity to environmental changes to recognize human movements, gestures, breathing, and other subtle actions and daily activities. The high precision and sensitivity of CSI make it widely applicable in health monitoring, smart homes, and human-computer interaction fields.
