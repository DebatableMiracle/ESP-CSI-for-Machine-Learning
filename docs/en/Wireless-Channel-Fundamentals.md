# Wireless Channel Overview[[中文]](docs/zh_CN/Signal-Processing-Fundamentals.md)

Wireless communication systems transmit data through wireless channels, where signals are influenced by various factors including attenuation, multipath effects, and interference. Understanding the characteristics of wireless channels is crucial for designing and optimizing wireless communication systems.

## Signal Representation

Complex Representation: Signals are represented in complex form to simplify analysis.

Amplitude and Phase: Amplitude represents signal strength, while phase represents its position.

## Characteristics of Wireless Channels

The main characteristics of wireless channels include:

- **Attenuation and Path Loss:** Signals attenuate and lose energy during propagation, and are also affected by path loss.
- **Multipath Effects:** Signals experience phase and amplitude variations due to multiple paths, impacting communication quality.
- **Delay Spread:** Extension of signal arrival times due to multipath effects.
- **Multi-User Interference:** Multiple users sharing the same spectrum can interfere with each other, affecting communication reliability and efficiency.
- **Shadowing:** Signal strength weakening due to obstacles.
## Relationship Between CSI and Wireless Channel Characteristics

Channel State Information (CSI) provides detailed channel information, aiding in understanding and utilizing various wireless channel characteristics to optimize the performance and reliability of wireless communication systems. Several important applications in wireless communication, especially involving multipath effects and Channel State Information (CSI), include:
